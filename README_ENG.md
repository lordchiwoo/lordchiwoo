Hello, My name is GuoYong Kim, or you can call me Leone, if my korean name is hard to pronunciate for you.  
I'm fast learner, so if there's any tech/framework/language needed, I follow some tutorials and samples, And get used to it fast.  
Also, I read a lot, have curiosity a lot(and google it right away).   
Those habie makes me to have knowledge base across various domain from biology to rocket science... except fashion... :(   

I always think about "How to do this in better way", Not only about code but also about User.  
Love to reviewing code/pair programming.  

Want to spend more time not on how to do it, but how to do it "Nicely".
