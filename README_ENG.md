Hello, My name is GuoYong Kim, or you can call me Leone, if my korean name is tongue-twister for you.  
I'm fast learner and have strong CS background, so if there's anything(frameworks/languages) needed, I follow some tutorials and samples, And get used to it fast.  
Also, I read a lot, have curiosity a lot(and google it right away).   
Those habit makes me to have knowledge base across various domain from biology to rocket science... except fashion... :(   

I always think about "How to do this in better way", Not only about code but also about User.  
Love to reviewing code/pair programming.  

Want to spend more time not on how to do it, but how to do it "Nicely".

## Troubleshooting and collaboration

>When I got requested for develop features related to accounting(settlement/reconciliation) and statistics in the field, not only implementing the requested items, but also suggesting those features that can be automated using information extracted from the DB. Moreover I took the initiative in refactoring codes not only to remove technical debts incurred while adding previous features, but also to improve Data/Code Consistency

>In the process of migrating the legacy site, while reviewing the code of the juniors, I had not only migrating the code/feature, but also tried to improve the existing structure and led the refactoring to facilitate better performance/readability/maintenance.

>When designing a 3D CAD program, I got the task of improving the data structure so that the data needed for rendering can be quickly retrieved. To understand, discuss and improve the rendering logic and the minimum required data, I had long and persistent discussion with the 3D engineer to analyzed the requirements and conducted R&D.

>When developing a new WMS system, I had meetings with the DHL 3PL (office workers and warehouse personnel) to organize the business requirements. I draw directions that can be improved using the program while receiving/releasing goods, and reinforce the planning while discussing how much would it be better if a feature is added.
